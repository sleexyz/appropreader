A digital take on transformablizing textual media.

*transformablize*:(verb) to make something (more) transformable.

###huh?
An example of a transformation on textual media would be annotating with a pen.

A book is by nature transformalizable, given that its margins are large enough

Because of the physics of real-life, the set of transformations on books or paper are limited.
<br>
appropreader seeks to explore a space of textual transformations with a different set of constraints: the physics of the virtual.

### why would we want to transformabalize?
why would we want to make something more transformable?
